# Predicting species abundance by implementing the ecological niche theory
Here, we present a reproducible example of the study conducted by de la Fuente et al. The study explored the potential predictive power of the abundance-suitability relationship. The abundance-suitability relationship predicts that habitat suitability predicted by species distribution models should explain the spatial variation in abundance. We tested this relationship for endemic species in the Australian Wet Tropics.

This reproducible example contains two scripts. The demo reproduces the results obtained for Mountain thornbill (*Acanthiza katherina*). In the first script, we show how we estimated habitat suitability by implementing ensemble species distribution models. The output of the first script is used in the second script to explore the relationship between observed abundance derived from 29 years of uninterrupted monitoring effort in the region, and habitat suitability derived from species distribution models. The second script also explores our models' predictive power. We used the fitted relationship between abundance and habitat suitability to extrapolate abundance across the species range. At the end of the second script, we explore various covariates that may influence the strength of the abundance-suitability relationship.
